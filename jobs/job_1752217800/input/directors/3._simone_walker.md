### ABOUT SECTION
Social media isn't about broadcasting—it's about belonging.

Two decades in social media has taught me that platforms change, algorithms evolve, but human connection remains constant. As Social Media Director at Galileus Media, I blend cutting-edge AI analytics with deep human understanding to create social strategies that don't just reach audiences—they build movements.

**My social philosophy:**
• Community First: Engagement over impressions, always
• Authentic Automation: Using AI to enhance, not replace, human interaction
• Platform Agnostic: Meeting audiences where they are, how they want
• ROI-Driven: Every post, story, and tweet serves a purpose

**What sets my approach apart:**
✓ Building social ecosystems that drive measurable business results
✓ Leveraging AI for predictive trends without losing authentic voice
✓ Creating viral moments that align with brand values
✓ Developing influencer partnerships that feel genuine

From TikTok to LinkedIn, Instagram to emerging platforms, I've helped brands navigate every major social shift. At Galileus Media, we're pioneering the next evolution: AI-enhanced social strategies that feel more human than ever.

Let's connect and explore how social media can transform your brand's relationship with its audience.
